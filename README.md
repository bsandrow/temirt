pmet
====

A Python library for interfacing with the [Trimet][1] [web api][2].

Note: An ApplicationID key is necessary to use the web API. This can be
obtained [here][3].

Notes
=====

I would have named the project pymet, as it is the named that jumps off the
paper, but there already is a project named [PyMET][4], which looks like an
abandoned attempt to do the same thing.
